        <p>Lily is a 36 year old who picked up wheelchair basketball as a means to remain fit after a car accident that left her paralysed from the waist down. She used to count her steps and kilometres ran but now finds it difficult to monitor her activity, and is worried that being in a wheelchair will cause her to put on weight. After each game she looks at the distance she covered during that game and how many calories she burnt. She adds the number of calories to the calories she burns through her metabolic rate and makes sure her calorie intake for the day is the same as or slightly less than this. She calculates the distance she covers over each month and sees that this maintains constant. As a result Lily feels just as fit before and doesn’t put on weight. </p>

        <p> Nigel is a 27 year old who has played wheelchair basketball for 7 years and has recently started coaching. He has not had much experience as a coach and finds it difficult to encourage the team to try harder during games. After each wheelchair basketball match, Nigel uses the ranking feature on the app to create a leaderboard which shows the players in descending order corresponding to their number of passes and shots for that game. Each month and year, Nigel creates another leaderboard showing the players in descending order for that entire month’s scores. The players look forward to seeing the leaderboard at training each week and enough competition is sparked that the number of the shots and passes between passes begins to increase. This in turn improves the team spirit between players as they work harder at playing as a team and passing the ball throughout games.</p>

        <p>Mike is a 30 year old man who has recently decided to take up wheelchair basketball in order to improve his health and fitness. However, Mike has never tried wheelchair basketball before and also finds it difficult to motivate himself to improve. He can’t see any improvements between games, and has no way to measure how hard he is trying so finds it easy to be lazy during a game and let the rest of the team do the work. In order to motivate himself, Mike starts measuring the number of passes he does and shots he takes compared to other teammates using the app. He finds himself at the bottom of the leaderboard for the first two games and decides to try harder in the next game. The number of Mike’s passes and shots begins to increase from game to game, and Mike also feels his fitness improve as he doesn’t feel as out of breath as he used to. </p>
