        <h5><strong> Introduction to project background and client</strong></h5>
        <p> Our client is Catherine Holloway, a senior lecturer in the Department of Computer Science based in the UCL Interaction Centre. Catherine’s work is focused on the design of assistive technologies; she is currently working on a project called Power-Up!, which looks to design new power sources and interfaces for assistive technologies. 

Our project stems from Catherine’s idea to help people with disabilities; the concept is to develop an activity tracker relevant to a specific sport, i.e. wheelchair basketball, to help wheelchair-bound people track their statistics during a game and also monitor their overall health. 
</p>
        <h5><strong> Project Goals</strong></h5>
        <p> 
Our aim is to collect data from wheelchair basketball players during a match or training session, and display it on an interface. The application will do this with the hope of encouraging players to improve their performance upon reflection of their statistics. This will in turn boost the general quality of wheelchair basketball across the team, increasing their chances of success in matches. In order to achieve this, the user interface must be user-friendly and easy to navigate, to ensure players will have the desire to regularly use it.
