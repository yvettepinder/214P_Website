                    <h5><strong> Introduction to project background and client</strong></h5>
                    <p> At the beginning of our project, our client was Catherine Holloway. Catherine is a senior lecturer in the Department of Computer Science based in the UCL Interaction Centre. Catherine’s work is focused on the design of assistive technologies; she is currently working on a project called Power-Up!, which looks to design new power sources and interfaces for assistive technologies. </p>

                    <p>Our project stemmed from Catherine’s idea to help people with disabilities; the initial concept was to develop an activity tracker relevant to a specific sport, i.e. wheelchair basketball, to help wheelchair-bound people track their statistics during a game and also monitor their overall health.
                    </p>

                    <p>However, due to unforeseen circumstances, our project and client changed. From this point, our client was Dr, Dean Mohamedally, a Principal Teaching Fellow for Applied Software Engineering and Industry Projects. Instead of requiring a particular user interface application for specific sensors, our new client requested a set of tools that could be used for the further development of assistive technologies. In this way, our client is now expecting a collection of smaller projects to retrieve, visualise and store data. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                            <h5><strong> Project Goals</strong></h5>
                            <p> The aim of our project is to develop a set of tools that can visualise data, retrieve data from an API, generate mock data linked to the cloud, and display data on a user interface (mobile application). The tools will demonstrate to future developers the potential to integrate health related information in an application with the intent to maintain, improve and rehabilitate people with disabilities. </p>
                            <p>Our project has focused these tools on wheelchair basketball players, as this is where our initial project began with our first client. However the concept can be applied to to other sports and activities. </p>
                            <p>Our mobile application allows users to view data with the hope of encouraging players to improve their performance upon reflection of their statistics. This will in turn boost the general quality of wheelchair basketball across the team, not only increasing their chances of success in matches, but also improving their overall wellbeing. </p>
                            <p>As our project has progressed, every part of research was valuable despite not necessarily being relevant to the final set of tools we have produced. The information we gathered from requirement gathering helped us produce our end product, and therefore is both useful for the development of our tools and the future technicians who may use our tools. For this reason, it is worth noting the progression from the research we undertook with our initial set of requirements. </p>

                    <p> Our first step for gathering requirements was an initial meeting with our client, Catherine Holloway. This meeting told us what software and hardware the client is intending we use at this point and what the client is expecting regarding the features of the application. We also gathered information on what other data we would need to collected in order to complete the requirements.

                    <p>Lily is a 36 year old who picked up wheelchair basketball as a means to remain fit after a car accident that left her paralysed from the waist down. She used to count her steps and kilometres ran but now finds it difficult to monitor her activity, and is worried that being in a wheelchair will cause her to put on weight. After each game she looks at the distance she covered during that game and how many calories she burnt. She adds the number of calories to the calories she burns through her metabolic rate and makes sure her calorie intake for the day is the same as or slightly less than this. She calculates the distance she covers over each month and sees that this maintains constant. As a result Lily feels just as fit before and doesn’t put on weight. </p>

                    <p>Mike is a 30 year old man who has recently decided to take up wheelchair basketball in order to improve his health and fitness. However, Mike has never tried wheelchair basketball before and also finds it difficult to motivate himself to improve. He can’t see any improvements between games, and has no way to measure how hard he is trying so finds it easy to be lazy during a game and let the rest of the team do the work. In order to motivate himself, Mike starts measuring the number of passes he does and shots he takes compared to other teammates using the app. He finds himself at the bottom of the leaderboard for the first two games and decides to try harder in the next game. The number of Mike’s passes and shots begins to increase from game to game, and Mike also feels his fitness improve as he doesn’t feel as out of breath as he used to. </p>
